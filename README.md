## Premise

In this project, I have leveraged linear programming to optimize the produciton schedule for Falcon Die Casting company to statisfy their customer's weekly demand.
The LP model has been aplied using the Excel Solver incorporating all the given constraints. The LP model decides which machine to use for producing a partiular part and do that in the available regular time and overtime. The objective is to reduce the overtime producition hours used in order to reduce the related costs.
